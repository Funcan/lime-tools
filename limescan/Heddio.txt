(1) Abosulte Z scale on GNUplot, not relative.  zrange fixes range, but not the allocation of the palette.
(2) Decimation causing roll off at edge of FFT bandwidth.
(3) Calibrations to make true power meter. [DONE - Untested]
(a) Antenna gain [Near field measured]
(b) SDR gain [maesured]
(c) Level correction.
(4) If using dipoles, safest to use X,Y and Z plane measurements!
(5) In gnuplot use fmat to check it works ok

(N) OpenGL surface - too fiddly for now.
