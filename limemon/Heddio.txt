(1) Monitor 30MHz bandwidth, and see activity vs time.

(2) How long to monitor,

(3) How to collect data?  
(a) Collect en mass, and then FFT en mass. Strictly contiguous time slices
Note OFDM signals have prefix, ideally want to sync up to get best picture.
[Discard prefix][Store Data] [Discard prefix][Store Data] ... [FFT] [FFT] ...
(b) Or repeat {Collect, FFT}, FFTW friendly, but unknown gap between time points.
(4) Do we still want to average?

LTE 10ms in 1ms slots, 20MHz sample at 30.72MS/s
WCDMA Frame rate 10ms
GSM 120ms/26 frames/s divided into 8 slots.
