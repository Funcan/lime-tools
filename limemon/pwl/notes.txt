ant.txt, is half the loss between two antennas 10cm apart.
It is intended for correcting frequency dependent loss of antenna.

lnaw.txt is the approx output dBFS with -50dBm input, and RX gain set to 48
lnah.txt is the approx output dBFS with -50dBm input, and RX gain set to 48
-50dBm, 48dB gain ==> -2dBFS
pwk-gain+k= input signal level at antenna.

We need to normalise these to gain and input.

pwl f0:f:f1 mx + c
